# Suave Presentation

by Henrik Feldt, 3rd September

## Abstract

Expect a smooth presentation on Suave, going through how to set up your Hello
World example, to getting the basics of an API working together with your
ReactJS app.

We'll start with the Hello World and a small guide to what I use as my
development environment. Then we'll move into the topic of building single page
applications, specifically with ReactJS.

The set up for ReactJS will include webpack, npm, RxJS and a supporting library
for making observable web requests from the browser.

Then I'll show how you can iterate very quickly with Suave and React, as well as
how RxJS can be used to provide push based state in your app, together with
EventSource on the server side.
